<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Registries provide a mechanism with which VO applications can
discover and select resources&#8212;first and foremost data and
services&#8212;that are relevant for a particular scientific problem.
This specification defines  an interface for searching this resource
metadata based on the IVOA's TAP protocol.  It specifies a set of tables
that comprise a useful subset of the information contained in the
registry records, as well as the table's data content in terms of the
XML VOResource data model.  The general design of the system is geared
towards allowing easy authoring of queries.</p>

<div class="body">

<div class="section"><h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>In the Virtual Observatory (VO), registries provide a means for
discovering useful resources, i.e., data and services.  Individual
publishers offer the descriptions for their resources ("resource
records") in publishing registries.  At the time of writing, there are
roughly 14000 such resource records active within the VO, originating
from about 20 publishing registries.</p>

<p>The protocol spoken by these
publishing registries, OAI-PMH only allows restricting queries by
modification date and identifier and is hence not suitable for data discovery.
Even if it were, data discovery would at least be fairly time consuming if
each client had to query dozens or, potentially, hundreds of
publishing registries.</p>

<p>To enable efficient data discovery nevertheless, there are services harvesting the
resource records from the publishing registries and offering rich query
languages.
The IVOA Registry
Interfaces specification <cite>std:RI1</cite> defined, among other aspects of
the VO registry system, such an interface
using SOAP and an early draft of an XML-based query language.</p>

<p>This document provides an update to the query ("searchable registry") part
of that specifiation (chapter 2), aimed towards
usage with current VO standards, in particular TAP <cite>std:TAP</cite>
and ADQL <cite>std:ADQL</cite>.  It follows the model of ObsCore
<cite>std:OBSCORE</cite> of defining a representation of a data model
within a relational database.  In this case, the data model is a
simplification of the VO's resource metadata interchange representation,
the VOResource XML format <cite>std:VOR</cite>.  The simplification
yields 13 tables.  For each table, TAP_SCHEMA metadata is given together
with rules for how to fill these tables from VOResource-serialized
metadata records as well as conditions on foreign keys and
recommendations on indices.</p>

<p>The resulting set of tables has a modest size by today's standards,
but is still non-trivial.  The largest table, <code>table_column</code>,
has about half a million rows at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The architecture laid out here allows client applications to perform "canned"
queries on behalf of their users as well as complex queries formulated
directly by advanced users, using the same TAP clients they employ to
query astronomical data servers.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a id="terms">Terminology</a></h3>

<p>The set of tables and their metadata specified here, together with
the mapping from VOResource ("ingestion rules") is collectively
called "relational registry schema" or relational registry for
short.</p>

<p>The specificiation additionally talks about how to embed these into TAP
services, gives additional user defined functions, talks about
discovering compliant services, etc.  Since all this is tightly coupled
to the "relational registry" as defined above, we do not 
introduce a new term for it.  Hence, the entire standard is now known as
"IVOA relational registry schema".</p>

<p>Historically, we intended to follow the ObsCore/ObsTAP model and
talked about RegTAP.  As changing this acronym is technically painful
(e.g., identifiers and URLs would need to be adapted), we kept it after
the distinction between the schema and its mapping on the one hand and
the its combination with a TAP service on the other went away.  This
means that the official acronym for "IVOA relational registry schema" is
RegTAP.  This aesthetic defect seems preferable to causing actual
incompatibilities.</p>

<p class="figurecaption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> IVOA Architecture
diagram with the Relational Registry specification (tagged with RegTAP) and
the related standards marked up.</p>
</div>

<p>This specification directly relates to other VO standards in the
following ways:</p>

<dl>
<dt>VOResource, v1.03 <cite>std:VOR</cite></dt>
<dd>VOResource sets the foundation for a formal definition of the data
model for resource records via its schema definition.  This document
refers to concepts laid down there via XPaths <cite>std:XPATH</cite>.</dd>


<dt>VODataService, v1.1 <cite>std:VODS11</cite></dt>
<dd>VODataService extends the VOResource data model by important
concepts and resource types (tablesets, data services, data
collections).  These concepts and types are reflected in the database
schema.  Again xpaths link this specification and VODataService.</dd>

<dt>Other Registry Extensions</dt>
<dd>Registry extensions are VO standards
defining how particular resources (e.g., Standards) or capabilities
(e.g., IVOA defined interfaces) are described.  Most aspects
introduced by them are reflected in the <code>res_detail</code> table using
xpaths into the registry documents.
This document should not in general need updates
for registry extension updates.  For completeness, we note the
versions current as of this specification: SimpleDALRegExt 1.0
<cite>std:DALREGEXT</cite>,
StandardsRegExt 1.0 <cite>std:STDREGEXT</cite>, TAPRegExt 1.0
<cite>std:TAPREGEXT</cite>, Registry Interfaces 1.0 <cite>std:RI1</cite>.</dd>

<dt>TAP, v1.0 <cite>std:TAP</cite></dt>
<dd>The queries against the schema defined in the present document, and the results of
these queries, will usually be transported using the Table Access
Protocol TAP.  It also allows discovering
local additions to the registry relations via TAP's metadata publishing
mechanisms.</dd>

<dt>IVOA Identifiers, v1.12 <cite>std:VOID</cite> </dt>
<dd>IVOA identifiers are something like the primary keys within the VO
registry; as such, they are actual primary keys of the central table of
the relational registry. Also, the notion of an authority as laid down
in IVOA Identifiers plays an important role as publishing registries can
be viewed as a realization of a set of authorities.</dd> </dl>

<p>This standard also relates to other IVOA standards:</p>

<dl>
<dt>ADQL, v2.0 <cite>std:ADQL</cite></dt>
<dd>The rules for ingestion are designed to allow
easy queries given the constraints of ADQL 2.0.  Also,
we give three functions that extend ADQL using the
language's built-in facility for user-defined functions.</dd>

<dt>RegTAP-STC</dt>
<dd>This specification will be complemented by a schema of four tables, also
under the <code>rr</code> schema making up the relational registry, that gives coverages of resources on the spatial,
temporal, spectral and redshift axes.  These will be defined in a
separate document.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="design">Design Considerations</a></h2>

<p>In the design of the tables, the goal has been to preserve as much of
VOResource and its extensions, including the element names, as
possible.</p>

<p>An overriding consideration has been, however, to make natural joins
between the tables behave usefully, i.e., to actually combine rows
relevant to the same entity (resource, table, capability, etc.).
To disambiguate column names that name the same concept on different
entities (name, description, etc.) and would therefore interfere with
the natural join, a shortened tag for the source object
is prepended to the name.  Thus, a <code>description</code> element within
a resource ends up in a column named
<code>res_description</code>, whereas the same element from a
capability becomes <code>cap_description</code>.</p>

<p>We further renamed some columns with respect to their VOResource
counterparts to avoid clashes with reserved words in popular database
management systems.  The alternatives would have been to either recommend
quoting them or burden ADQL translation layers with the task of
automatically converting them to delimited identifiers.  Both
alternatives seemed either confusing or impacting robustness.</p>

<p>Furthermore, camel-case identifiers have been converted to
underscore-separated ones (thus, <code>standardId</code>  becomes
<code>standard_id</code>) to have all-lowercase column names; this saves
potential headache if users choose to reference the columns using SQL
delimited identifiers.  Dashes in VOResource attribute names are
converted to underscores, too, with the exception of
<code>ivo-id</code>, which is just rendered <code>ivoid</code>.</p>

<p>Another design goal of this specification has been that different registries
operating on the same set of registry records will return identical responses
for most queries; hence, we try to avoid relying on features left not
defined by ADQL (e.g., the case sensitivity of string matches).  However,
with a view to non-uniform support for information retrieval-type
queries in database systems, the <code>ivo_hasword</code> user defined
function is not fully specified here; queries employing it may yield
different results on different implementations, even if they operate on
the same set of resource records.</p>


</div>  <!-- subsection design -->

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="casenorm">Note on case normalization</a></h2>

<p>ADQL has no operators for case-insensitive matching of strings.  To
allow for robust and straightforward queries nevertheless, most columns
containing values not usually intended for display are required to be
converted to lower case; in the table descriptions below, there are
explicit requirements on case normalization near the end of each
section.  This is particularly important when the entities to be
compared are defined to be case-insensitive (e.g., ucds, IVORNs).
Client software that can inspect user-provided arguments (e.g., when
filling template queries) should also convert the respective fields to
lower case.</p>

<p>This conversion MUST cover all ASCII letters, i.e., A through Z.  
The conversion SHOULD take place according to
algorithm R2 in section 3.13, "Default Case Algorithms" of 
<cite>std:UNICODE</cite>.  In practice, non-ASCII characters are not expected
to occur in columns for which lowercasing is required.</p>

<p>Analogously, case-insensitive comparisons as required by some of the
user-defined functions for the relational registry MUST compare
the ASCII letters without regard for case.  They SHOULD compare according
to D144 in <cite>std:UNICODE</cite>.</p>

</div> <!-- casenorm -->


<div class="section">
<h2><a id="qnameatts">QNames in VOResource attributes</a></h2>
<p>VOResource and its extensions make use of XML QNames in attribute
values, most prominently in <code>xsi:type</code>.  The standard
representation of these QNames in XML instance documents makes use of an
abbreviated notation employing prefixes declared using the xmlns mechanism
as discussed in <cite>std:XMLNS</cite>.  Within an ADQL-exposed database, no
standard mechanism exists that could provide a similar mapping of URLs
and abbreviations.  The correct way to handle this problem would thus be
to have full QNames in the database (e.g.,
<code>{http://www.ivoa.net/xml/ConeSearch/v1.0}ConeSearch</code> for the
canonical <code>cs:ConeSearch</code>).  This, of course, would make for
excessively tedious and error-prone querying.</p>

<p>For various reasons, VOResource authors have always been encouraged
to use a set of "standard" prefixes.  This allows an easy and, to users,
unsurprising exit from the problem of the missing xmlns declarations:
For the representation of QNames within the database, these recommended
prefixes are now mandatory. Future VOResource extensions define their
mandatory prefixes themselves.</p>  

<p>Following the existing practice, minor version changes are not in
general reflected in the recommended prefixes—e.g., both VODataService
1.0 and VODataService 1.1 use <code>vs:</code>.  For reference, here is
a table of XML namespaces and prefixes for namespaces relevant to this
specification:</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="vorutypes">XPaths</a></h2>

<p>This specification piggybacks on top of the well-established
VOResource standard.  This means that it does not define a full data model,
but rather something like a reasonably query-friendly view of a partial
representation of one.  The link between the actual data model, i.e.,
VOResource and its extensions as defined by the XML Schema documents, and
the fields within this database schema, is provided by
xpaths, which are here slightly abbreviated for both brevity and
generality.</p>

<p>All xpaths given in this specifiation are assumed to be relative to
the enclosing <code>vr:Resource</code> element; these are called
"resource xpaths" in the following.  If resource xpaths are to be
applied to an OAI-PMH response, the xpath expression
<code>*/*/*/oai:metadata/ri:Resource</code> must be prepended to it,
with the canonical prefixes from section <span
class="xref">qnameatts</span> implied.  The resource xpaths themselves
largely do not need explicit namespaces since VOResource elements are by
default unqualified.  Elements and attributes from non-VOResource
schemata have the canonical namespace prefixes, which in this
specification only applies to several <code>xsi:type</code> attribute
names.</p>

<p>Some tables draw data from several different VOResource elements.
For those, we have introduced an extended syntax with additional
metacharacters (, ), and |, where the vertical bar denotes an
alternative and the parentheses grouping.  For instance, our notation
<code>/(tableset/schema/|)table/</code> corresponds to the two xpaths
<code>/table</code> and <code>/tableset/schema/table</code>.</p>

<p>Within the Virtual Observatory, the link between data models and
concrete data representations is usually made using utypes.
Since VOResource is directly modelled
in XML Schema, the choice of XPath as the bridging formalism is 
compelling, though, and utypes themselves are not necessary for the
operation of a TAP service containing the relational registry.
TAP, however, offers fields for utypes in its TAP_SCHEMA.  Since they
are not otherwise required, this specification takes the liberty of
using them to denote the xpaths.</p>

<p>In the metadata for tables and columns below, the utypes given are
obtained from the xpaths by simply prepending them with
<code>xpath:</code>.  To avoid repetition, we allow relative xpaths:
when the xpath in a column utype does not start with a slash, it is
understood that is must be concatenated with the table utype to obtain
the full xpath.</p>

<p>For illustration, if a table has a utype of
<code>xpath:/capability/interface/</code> and a column within this table
has a utype of <code>xpath:accessURL/@use</code>, the resulting resource
xpath would come out to be
<code>/capability/interface/accessURL/@use</code>; to match this in an
OAI-PMH response, the xpath would be
<code>*/*/*/oai:metadata/ri:Resource/capability/interface/accessURL/@use</code>.
</p>

<p>While clients MUST NOT rely on these utypes in either TAP_SCHEMA or the
metadata delievered with TAP replies, service operators SHOULD provide them, in
particular when there are local extensions to the relational registry in their
services.  Giving xpaths for extra columns and tables helps human
interpretation of them at least when the defining schema files are
available.</p>

<p>Resource xpaths are also used in the res_details table (section <span
class="xref">table_res_detail</span>).  These are normal xpaths
(although again understood relative to the enclosing Resource element),
which, in particular, means that they are case sensitive.  On the other
hand, to clients they are simply opaque strings, i.e., clients cannot
just search for any xpaths into VOResource within res_details.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="registration">Discovering Relational Registries</a></h2>

<p>The relational registry can be part of any TAP service.  The presence
of the tables discussed here is indicated by declaring support for the
data model <code>Registry 1.0</code> with the IVORN
<code>ivo://ivoa.net/std/RegTAP#1.0</code> in the service's
capabilities (see <cite>std:TAPREGEXT</cite>).  Technically, this
entails adding</p>

<pre><![CDATA[
<dataModel ivo-id="ivo://ivoa.net/std/RegTAP#1.0"
  >Registry 1.0</dataModel>
]]></pre>

<p>as a child of the capability element with the type
<code>{http://www.ivoa.net/xml/TAPRegExt/v1.0}TableAccess</code>.</p>

<p>A client that knows the access URL of one TAP service containing 
a relational
registry can thus discover all other services exposing one. The <a
href="#example-findregtap">"Find all TAP endpoints offering the
relational registry"</a> example in section
<span class="xref">sample_queries</span> shows a query that does
this.</p>

<p>It is recommended to additionally register a relational registry as a
VODataService data collection and connect this and the TAP services
with a pair of service-for/served-by relations.  This allows giving more
metadata on the data content like, for example, the frequency of
harvesting.</p>

<p>Services implementing this data model that do not (strive to) offer
the full data content of the VO registry (like domain-specific
registries or experimental systems) MUST NOT declare the above data
model in order to not invite clients expecting the VO registry to send
queries to it.</p>

</div><!-- subsection registration -->

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="vortables">VOResource Tables</a></h2>

<p>In the following table descriptions, the names of tables and columns
are normative and MUST be used as given, and all-lowercase.  On the
values in the <code>utype</code> columns within <code>TAP_SCHEMA</code>,
see section <span class="xref">vorutypes</span>.  All columns defined in
this document MUST have a 1 in the <code>std</code> column of the
<code>TAP_SCHEMA.table_columns</code> table.  Unless otherwise
specified, all values of ucd and unit in
<code>TAP_SCHEMA.table_columns</code> are NULL for columns defined here.
Descriptions are not normative (as given, they usually are taken from
the schema files of VOResource and its extensions with slight
redaction).  Registry operators MAY provide additional columns in their
tables, but they MUST provide all columns given in this
specification.</p>

<p>All table descriptions start out with brief remarks on the
relationship of the table to the VOResource XML data model.  Then, the
columns are described in a selection of TAP_SCHEMA metadata. For each
table, recommendations on explicit primary and foreign keys as well as
indexed columns are given, where it is understood that primary and
foreign keys are already indexed in order to allow efficient joins;
these parts are not normative, but operators should ensure decent
performance for queries assuming the presence of the given indices and
relationships.  Finally, lowercasing requirements
(normative) are given.</p>

<h3><a id="table_resource">The resource Table</a></h3>

<p>The <code>rr.resource</code> table contains most atomic members of
<code>vr:Resource</code> that have a 1:1 relationship to the resource
itself.  Members of derived types are, in general, handled through 
the <code>res_detail</code>
table even if 1:1 (see <span class="xref">table_res_detail</span>).  The
content_level, content_type, waveband, and rights members are 1:n but still appear
here.  If there are multiple values, they are concatenated with hash
characters (#).  Use the <code>ivo_hashlist_has</code> ADQL extension
function to check for the presence of a single value.  This convention
saves on tables while not complicating common queries significantly.</p>

<p>A local addition is the <code>creator_seq</code> column.  It contains
all content of the <code>name</code> elements below a resource element
<code>curation</code> child's <code>creator</code> children,
concatenated with a sequence of semicolon and blank characters (<code>";
"</code>). The individual parts must be concatenated preserving the
sequence of the XML elements.  The resulting string is primarily intended
for display purposes ("author list") and is hence not case-normalized.
It was added since the equivalent of an author list is expected to be
a metadatum that is displayed fairly frequently, but also since the
sequence of author names is generally considered significant.  The
<code>res_role</code> table, on the other hand, does not allow
recovering the input sequence of the rows belonging to one resource.</p>

<p>The <code>res_type</code> column reflects the lower-cased value of
the <code>ri:Resource</code> element's <code>xsi:type</code> attribute,
where the canonical prefixes are used.  While custom or experimental
VOResource extensions may lead to more or less arbitrary strings in that
column, VOResource and its IVOA-recommended extensions at the time of
writing define the following values for <code>res_type</code>:</p>

<dl>
<dt>vg:authority</dt>
<dd>A naming authority (these records allow resolving who is responsible
for IVORNs with a certain authority; cf. <cite>std:VOID</cite>)</dd>
<dt>vg:registry</dt>
<dd>A registry is considered a publishing registry if it contains a
capability element with <code>xsi:type="vg:Harvest"</code>.  Old,
RegistryInterface 1-compliant registries also use this type with a
capability of type <code>vg:Search</code>.  The relational registry as
specified here, while superceding these old <code>vg:Search</code>
capabilities, does <em>not</em> use this type any more.  See section
<span class="xref">registration</span> on how to locate services
supporting it.</dd>
<dt>vr:organisation</dt>
<dd>The main purpose of an organisation as a registered resource is to
serve as a publisher of other resources.</dd>
<dt>vr:resource</dt>
<dd>Any entity or component of a VO application that is describable and
identifiable by a IVOA Identifier; while it is technically possible to
publish such records, the authors of such records should probably be
asked to use a more specific type.</dd>
<dt>vr:service</dt>
<dd>A resource that can be invoked by a client to perform some action on
its behalf</dd>
<dt>vs:catalogservice</dt>
<dd>A service that interacts with one or more specified tables having
some coverage of the sky, time, and/or frequency.</dd>
<dt>vs:dataservice</dt>
<dd>A service for accessing astronomical data; publishers choosing
this over <code>vs:catalogservice</code> probably intend to communicate
that there are no actual sky positions in the tables exposed.</dd>
<dt>vs:datacollection</dt>
<dd>A schema as a logical grouping of data which, in general, is
composed of one or more accessible datasets.  Use the
<code>rr.relationship</code> table to find out services that allow
access to the data (the <code>served_by</code> relation), and/or look for values for
<code>/accessURL</code> in
<a href="#table_res_detail">rr.res_detail</a>.</dd>
<dt>vstd:standard</dt>
<dd>A description of a standard specification.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code>status</code> attribute of <code>vr:Resource</code> is
considered an implementation detail of the XML serialization and is not
kept here.  Neither <code>inactive</code> nor <code>deleted</code>
records may be kept in the <code>resource</code> table.  Since all
other tables in the relational registry should keep a foreign key on the
<code>ivoid</code> column, this implies that only metadata on
<code>active</code> records 
is being kept in the relational registry. In other words, users can
expect a resource to exist and work if they find it in a relational 
registry .</p>

<h3><a id="table_res_role">The res_role Table</a></h3>

<p>This table subsumes the contact, publisher, contributor, 
and creator members of the
VOResource data model.  They have been combined into a single table to
reduce the total number of tables, and also in anticipation of a unified
data model for such entities in future versions of VOResource.</p>

<p>The actual role is given in the <code>base_role</code> column, which
can be one of <code>contact</code>, <code>publisher</code>, <code>contributor</code>, or
<code>creator</code>.  Depending on this value, here are the xpaths
for the table fields (we have abbreviated
<code>/curation/publisher</code>
as cp, <code>/curation/contact</code> as co, <code>/curation/creator</code> 
as cc,
and <code>/curation/contributor</code> as cb):</p>

<table class="results" frame="box" rules="rows">
<tr><th>base_role value</th>
<th>contact</th>
<th>publisher</th>
<th>creator</th>
<th>contributor</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>role_name</td>
<td>co/name</td>
<td>cp</td>
<td>cc/name</td>
<td>cb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>role_ivoid</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>logo</td>
<td>co/logo</td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>cc/logo</td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Not all columns are available for each role type in VOResource.  For
example, contacts have no logo, and creators no telephone members.  Unavailable
metadata (marked with N/A in the above table) MUST be represented with NULL
values in the corresponding columns.</p>

<p>Note that, due to current practice in the VO, it is not easy to
predict what <code>role_name</code> will contain; it could be a single
name, where again the actual format is unpredictable
(full first name, initials in front or behind, or
even a project name), but it could as well be a full author list.  Thus,
when matching against <code>role_names</code>, you will have to use
rather lenient regular expressions.  Changing this, admittedly
regrettable, situation would
probably require a change in the VOResource schema.</p>

<h3><a id="table_interface">The interface Table</a></h3>

<p>The <code>interface</code> table subsumes both the
<code>vr:Interface</code> and <code>vr:accessURL</code> types from
VOResource.  The integration of <code>accessURL</code>  into
the <code>interface</code>  table means that an interface in the
relational registry can only have one access URL, where in VOResource it
can have many.  In practice, this particular VOResource capability has
not been used by registry record authors.  Since access URLs are
probably the item most queried for, it seems warranted to save one
indirection when querying for them.</p>

<p>This specification deprecates the <code>maxOccurs="unbounded"</code>
in the definition of <code>Interface</code>'s <code>accessURL</code>
child in the XML schema
<code>http://www.ivoa.net/xml/VOResource/v1.0</code>; in future versions
of VOResource, implementations can expect this to be
<code>maxOccurs="1"</code>.  Meanwhile, implementation behaviour in the
presence of multiple access URLs in an interface is undefined.</p>

<p>The table contains an
integer-typed column <code>intf_index</code> to disambiguate multiple
interfaces of one resource.  Operators are free to choose the
actual values as convenient, although it is recommended to just
enumerate the interfaces in their physical sequence per resource.</p>

<p>The <code>query_type</code> column is a hash-joined list (analoguos
to <code>waveband</code>, etc. in the resource table), as
the XML schema allows listing up to two request methods.</p>

<p>This table only contains interface elements from within capabilities.
Interface elements in StandardsRegExt records are ignored in the
relational registry,
and they must not be inserted in this table, since doing so would disturb
the foreign key from interface into capability.  In other words,
the relational registry requires every interface to have a parent capability.</p>

<p>Analogous to <code>resource.res_type</code>, the
<code>intf_type</code> column contains type names; VOResource extensions
can define new types here, but at the time of writing, the following
types are mentioned in IVOA-recommended schemata:</p>

<dl>
<dt>vs:paramHTTP</dt>
<dd>A service invoked via an HTTP query with either form-urlencoded or
multipart form-data parameters.</dd>
<dt>vr:WebBrowser</dt>
<dd>A (form-based) interface intended to be accessed interactively by a
user via a web browser.</dd>
<dt>vg:OAIHTTP</dt>
<dd>A standard OAI PMH interface using HTTP queries with form-urlencoded
parameters.</dd>
<dt>vg:OAISOAP</dt>
<dd>A standard OAI PMH interface using a SOAP Web Service
interface.</dd>
<dt>vr:WebService</dt>

<h3><a id="table_validation">The validation Table</a></h3>

<p>The <code>validation</code> subsumes the

and <code>vr:Capability</code>.</p>

<p>If the <code>cap_index</code> column in <code>NULL</code> the
validation comprises the entire resource.  Otherwise, only the
referenced capability has been validated.</p>

<p>While it is recommended that harvesters only accept resource records
from their originating registries, it is valuable to gather validation
results from various sources.  Hence, harvesters for the relational
registry may choose to obtain validation data from the OAI-PMH endpoints
of various registries by not harvesting just for the ivo_managed set and
generate <code>rr.validation</code> rows from these records.  This can
trigger potentially problematic behaviour when the original registry
updates  its resource record in that naive implementations will lose all
third-party validation rows; this may actually be the correct behaviour,
since an update of the registry record might very well indicate
validation-relevant changes in the underlying services.  Implementations
are free to handle or ignore validation results as they see fit, and
they may add validation results of their own.</p>

<p>For convenicence, we repeat the definition of the validation
levels from <cite>std:RM</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>0</dt>
<dd>The resource has a description that is stored in a registry.  This
level does not imply a compliant description.</dd>

<dt>1</dt>
<dd>In addition to meeting the level 0 definition, the resource
description conforms syntactically to this standard and to the encoding
scheme used. </dd>

<dt>2</dt>
<dd>In addition to meeting the level 1 definition, the resource
description refers to an existing resource that has been demonstrated to
be functionally compliant.  When the resource is a service, it is
considered to exist and to be functionally compliant if use of the
Service.InterfaceURL or Service.BaseURL responds without error when used
as intended by the resource.  If the service is a standard one, it
must also demonstrate the response is syntactically compliant with the
service standard in order to be considered functionally compliant.  If
the resource is not a service, then the ReferenceURL must be shown to
return a document without error.</dd>

<dt>3</dt>
<dd>In addition to meeting the level 2 definition, the resource
description has been inspected by a human and judged to comply
semantically to this standard as well as meeting any additional minimum
quality criteria (e.g., providing values for important but non-required
metadata) set by the human inspector. [...]</dd>


<dt>4</dt>

<dd>In addition to meeting the level 3 definition, the resource
description meets additional quality criteria set by the human inspector
and is therefore considered an excellent description of the resource.
Consequently, the resource is expected to operate well as part of a
VO application or research study.</dd>

<h3><a id="table_res_detail">The res_detail Table</a></h3>

<p>The <code>res_detail</code> table is the relational registry's primary means for
extensibility as well as a fallback for less-used simple
metadata.  Conceptually, it stores triples of resource entity
references, resource xpaths,
and values, where resource entities can be resource records themselves
or capabilities.  Thus, metadata with values that are either
string-valued or sets of strings can be represented in this table.</p>

<p>As long as the metadata that needs to be represented in the
relational registry for new VOResource extensions is simple enough, no changes to the schema defined
here will be neccessary as these are introduced.  Instead, the extension itself simply defines
new xpaths to be added in <code>res_detail</code>.</p>

<p>Some complex metadata&#8212;<code>tr:languageFeature</code> or
<code>vstd:key</code> being examples&#8212;cannot be kept in this table.
If a representation of such information in the relational registry is
required, this standard will need to be changed.</p>

<p>Appendix <span class="xref">d_u_list</span> gives a list
of resource xpaths from the registry extensions
that were recommendations at the time of writing.  
For the resource xpaths marked with an exclamation mark there,
xpath/value pairs MUST be generated whenever the corresponding
metadata items are given in a resource record.
For the remaining resource xpaths, these pairs should be provided if
convenient; they mostly concern test queries and other curation-type
information that, while unlikely to be useful to normal users, may be
relevant to curation-type clients that, e.g., ascertain the continued 
operation of services.</p>

<p>Some detail values must be interpreted case-insensitively; this
concerns, in particular, IVORNs like the TAP data model type.  For other
rows&#8212;the test queries are immediate examples&#8212;, changing the case
will likely break the data.  In order to avoid having to give and
implement case normalization rules by detail xpath, no case normalization 
is done on detail values at all, and users and clients will have to use
the <code>ivo_nocasematch</code> user defined function (see section
<span class="xref">adqludf</span>) when locating
case-insensitive values.  For the resource xpaths given in Appendix <span
class="xref">d_u_list</span>, this concerns all items with xpaths ending
in <code>@ivo-id</code>.</p>

<p>Individual
ingestors
MAY choose to expose additional metadata using other utypes, provided
they are formed according to the rules in 
section <span class="xref">vorutypes</span> (this rule is intended
to minimize the risk of later clashes).</p>

<p>In addition to the metadata listed in this specification, 
metadata defined in future
IVOA-approved VOResource extensions MUST or SHOULD be present in
<code>res_details</code> as the extensions require it.</p>

registry queries, in particular for users new to the data model.</p>

<p>Where these queries locate access URLs of standard services, they
contain <code>intf_role='std'</code> conditions. Desktop clients should
probably include this to weed out nonstandard interfaces on standard
capabilities, which are rare but technically legal; on the other hand,
there are fairly standards-compliant interfaces for which the operator
neglected to set <code>role="std"</code>, and the respective services
would be missed with such a condition. Hand-crafted queries can probably
typically  do without restraining role since most standard capabilities
in real-world resources only have
one&#8212;standard&#8212;interface.</p>

<p>Note that the representation of StandardsRegExt's 
<code>status</code>  and <code>use</code>
attributes as well as its <code>key</code> would require sequences of
complex objects, which is impossible using <code>res_detail</code>.
Hence, the respective metadata is not queriable
within the relational registry. Similarly, complex TAPRegExt metadata on
languages, user defined functions, and the like cannot be
represented in this table.  Since these pieces of metadata do not seem
relevant to resource discovery and are geared towards other uses of the
respective VOResource extensions, a more complex model does not seem
warrented just so they can be exposed.</p>

<div class="section"><h2><a id="appBP">Implementation notes</a></h2>

<p>This appendix contains a set of constraints and recommendations for
implementing the relational registry model on actual RDBMSes, originating
partly from an analysis of the data content of the VO registry in February
2013, partly from a consideration of limits in various XML schema documents.
This concerns, in particular, minimum lengths for columns of type
adql:VARCHAR.  Implementations MUST NOT truncate strings of length equal
to or smaller than the minimal lengths given here; the limitations are
not, however, upper limits, and indeed, when choosing an implementation
strategy it is in general preferable to not impose artificial length
restrictions, in particular if no performance penalty is incurred.</p>

<p>These notes can also be useful with a view to preparing user interfaces for
the relational registry, since input forms and similar user interface
elements invariably have limited space; the limits here give reasonable
defaults for the amount of data that should minimally be manipulatable
by a user with reasonable effort.</p>

<p>The <code>ivoid</code> field present in every table of this
specification merits special consideration, on the one hand due to its
frequency, but also since other IVOA identifiers stored in the
relational registry should probably be treated analoguously.
Given that IVORNs in the 2013 data fields have a maximum
length of roughly 100 characters, we propose that a maximum length of 
255 should be sufficient even when taking possible fragment identifiers
into account.</p>

<div class="tablewrap">
  <table class="results" frame="box" rules="rows">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="thVertical" >Field type</th>

        <th class="thVertical" >Pertinent Fields</th>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The relational registry also contains some date-time values. The most
straightforward implementation certainly is to use SQL timestamps.
Other relational registry fields that straightforwardly map to common
SQL types are those that require numeric values, viz.,
<code>REAL</code>, <code>SMALLINT</code>, and
<code>INTEGER</code>.  The following table summarizes these:</p>

<div class="tablewrap">
  <table class="results" frame="box" rules="rows">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="thVertical" >Field type</th>
        <th class="thVertical" >Datatype</th>
        <th class="thVertical" >Pertinent Fields</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>floating point</td>
        <td><code>REAL</code></td>
        <td>resource.region_of_regard</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>small integer</td>
        <td><code>SMALLINT</code></td>
        <td>capability.cap_index<br />
          res_schema.schema_index<br />
          res_table.schema_index<br />

          table_column.table_index
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The fields containing Utypes, UCDs, and Units are treated in parallel
here. The 2013 registry data indicates a length of 128 characters is
sufficient for real-world purposes; actually, at least UCDs and Units
could of course grow without limitations, but it seems unreasonable
anything longer than a typical line might actually be useful.  As far as
utypes are concerned, we expect those to shrink rather than grow with
new standardization efforts.</p>

<p>In this category, we also summarize our resource xpaths.  With the
conventions laid down in this document, it seems unlikely that future
extensions to VOResource will be so deeply nested that 128 characters
will not be sufficient for their resource xpaths.</p>


<div class="tablewrap">
  <table class="results" frame="box" rules="rows">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="thVertical" >Field type</th>
        <th class="thVertical" >Datatype suggested</th>
        <th class="thVertical" >Pertinent Fields</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Utype(s)<br />UCD(s)<br />Units<br/>xpaths</td>
        <td><code>VARCHAR(128)</code></td>
        <td>res_schema.schema_utype<br />
          res_table.table_utype<br />
          table_column.ucd<br />
          table_column.unit<br />
          table_column.utype<br />
          intf_param.ucd<br />
          intf_param.unit<br />

          res_detail.detail_xpath
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The relational registry further has an
e-mail field, for which we chose 128 characters as a reasonable upper
limit (based on a real maximum of 40 characters in the 2013 data).
There are furthermore URLs (in addition to access and reference URLs,
there are also URLs for the WSDL of SOAP services and logos for roles).
Due to the importance of in particular the access URLs we strongly
recommend to use non-truncating types here.  Empirically, there are
access URLs of up to 224 characters in 2013 (reference URLs are less
critical at a maximum of 96 characters).  Expecting that with REST-based
services, URL lengths will probably rather tend down than up, we still
permit truncation at 255 characters.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the fields that actually contain what is
basically free text.
For these, we have made a choice from reasonable powers of two lengths 
considering the actual lengths in the 2013 registry data. 
A special case are fields that either contain natural language text (the
descriptions) or those that have grown without limit historically
(resource.creator_seq, and, giving in to current abuses discussed above,
res_role.role_name).  For all such fields, no upper limit can sensibly
be defined.  However, since certain DBMSes (e.g., MySQL older than
version 5.6) cannot index fields with a TEXT datatype and thus using
VARCHAR may be necessary at least for frequenly-searched fields, we give
the maximal length of the fields in the 2013 registry in parentheses after
the column designations for the TEXT datatype:</p>

<div class="section"><h2><a id="appMkut">XSLT to enumerate Relational
Registry XPaths</a>
</h2>

<p>The (non-normative) following XSL stylesheet emits xpaths as
discussed in section <span class="xref">vorutypes</span> when applied to a
VOResource extension.  Considering readability and limitations of XSLT, this is
not fully general -- if VOResource extensions started to inherit from other
extensions' subclasses of Resource, Capability, or Interface, this stylesheet
will need to be extended.</p>

<p>Still, it is a useful tool when evaluating how to map a given extension
to the relational registry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Changed the data model identifier to
  <code>ivo://ivoa.net/std/RegTAP#1.0</code> to match usage with a
  later standards record.</li>
  <li>Fixed a typo in a column name: schema.schemaname is now schema.schema_name

  <li>Recovered 
  <code>/capability/uploadMethod/@ivo-id</code> res_detail keys that was
  accidentally lost in a previous version.</li>

  <li>Clarification of nomenclature.</li>

<div class="section"><h3><a id="changes-20130909">Changes from WD-20130909</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Updates for REC of SimpleDALRegExt, which contains versions 1.1 of
  both the sia and the ssap XML schemas; thisi means there are now additional
  namespace URIs to take into accound, as well as new res_detail xpaths
  <code>/capability/maxSearchRadius</code>, 
  <code>/capability/maxImageSize</code>, and 
  <code>/testQuery/pos/refframe</code>.</li>
  <li>Reinstated makeutypes.xslt script; it's useful even with the new

<div class="section"><h3><a id="changes-20130411">Changes from WD-20130411</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The final utype reform: most of our ex-utype strings aren't called utypes
  any more, they're fairly plain xpaths.  Consequently, 
  <code>res_detail.detail_utype</code> has been renamed 
  <code>res_detail.detail_xpath</code>.</li>
  <li>Renamed some columns and the subject table to relieve the need of quoting
  in MS SQL Server (or, in the case or <code>use_param</code>, maintain
  consistency after the renaming):<br/>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Old</th><th>New</th></tr>

  </li>
  <li>rr.intf_param grew the arraysize and delim columns that before
    accidentally were only present in rr.table_column.</li>
  <li>Added warnings about having to match case-insensitively in
  res_detail.detail_value for IVORN-valued rows.</li>
  <li>Restored the foreign key from interface to capability.  Mandating
  ignoring interface elements from StandardsRegExt records really is the
  lesser evil.</li>
  <li><code>resource.region_of_regard</code> now must have unit metadata
  declared.</li>
  <li>We now explicitely deprecate multiple access urls per interface
  and announce that single access URLs will be enforced in future
  VOResource versions.</li>

<div class="section"><h3><a id="changes-20130305" shape="rect"/><span class="secnum"/>Changes from WD-20130305</h3>

<ul>
<li>intf_index is now required to be unique within a resource, not a
capability; this is because StandardsRegExt has interfaces outside
of capabilities.  In consequence, the intf_param no longer has a
cap_index column, and its foreign key is just ivoid and intf_index.</li>
<li>Added handling for the StandardsRegExt schema element.</li>
<li>The list of res_details utypes was moved to an appendix since
it was too long to be included in the running text.</li>
<li>Redation for WD publication.</li>

<li>footprint, data_url, facility, and instrument are no longer in rr.resource

<li>For VOResource compliance, intf_param has no flag column any more.</li>
<li>res_role.base_utype is renamed to res_role.base_role and no longer
pretends to be a utype fragments; also, the content is now a simple
word..</li>
<li>intf_param.use is now called intf_param.use_param to avoid possible
clashes with reserved SQL words.</li>
